== Introduction ==

This gadget will display visual thumbnails for tagged Bookmark feeds from variousSocial Bookmarking sites.  The gadget can read feeds from *Delicious*, *Diigo*, *Reddit*, and *StumbleUpon*.  

The gadget has two display themes, a traditional _iGoogle_ theme, and one that looks like an _iPhone_.  The gadget uses RSS/Atom from the Social Bookmarking sites and a service from [http://shrinktheweb.com ShrinkTheWeb.com] to deliver thumbnails of your links to your iGoogle page.  

You can display the bookmarks as an icon or as a list, with small or large thumbnails.

This gadget was developed by Tim at http://www.timalosi.com

== Update ==
(4/12/2011)  I just posted some slight code changes.  STW required some changes to keep the images being shown correctly.  Tim

== Screen Shots ==
The screen shot below shows three of the four display themes.  There are two themes, an iPhone like theme and a straight iGoogle theme.  For each theme, you can display the links as icons or as a list.
